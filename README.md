## Overview
Use classes to create a functional command line blackjack game. Leave the game's functionality until the end, first get the class structure figured out. From here you can implement methods and fields to store data you think you would need during a blackjack game. 
## Structure
User Story #1
Create a class structure that mimics a deck of cards. Remember decks as well as hands are made up of cards. Feel free to create the structure in any way you see fit.

Your card and deck implementations should NOT be coupled to Blackjack; you should be able to reuse them to implement a poker or bridge game application.

User Story #2
Add methods and fields to your classes that mimic the functionality of shuffling and dealing a deck of cards. Remember that when a card is dealt you have to remove it from the current deck. You should be able to print out a shuffled deck to the terminal.

User Story #3
Deal two hands of cards - one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Allow the players to Hit (add cards to their hand) or Stay (not add cards to their hand) in accordance to the rules of blackjack shown in the wiki.

Do not worry about the multiple values for Ace until your basic game logic is working. Assume they are either 1 or 11 to start.

User Story #4
The Dealer's decisions are based on game logic in the program.

The Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.

User Story #5
Determine the winner of each round by implementing the remaining rules of Blackjack (such as going over 21) and comparing hand values.
## Completion Criteria
Your program must NOT be contained in one procedural main(). You MUST design a OO class structure.

When the game begins both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.

If a player or dealer is dealt 21 the game is over. Otherwise the player can choose to hit as many times as they wish until they choose to stay.

Once the player has completed their turn the dealer will begin their turn, automatically hitting or staying according to the Blackjack rules.

The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.

The winner is displayed.

## Challenges
It was tough to get the code to print out exactly what I was looking for. I allowed myself to get lost in my own code which really slowed me down. I focused on multiple parts at once instead of just one and then moving on. Missing some of the discussions in class made this tough. 
## Lessons Learned
Focusing on just one piece at a time is important. Trying to do too much will hinder progress.
